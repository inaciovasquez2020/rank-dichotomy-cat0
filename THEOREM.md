Rank Dichotomy (CAT(0) cube complexes) — Formal Statement
Setting
Let X be a finite-dimensional CAT(0) cube complex.
Let Γ act properly and cocompactly on X by cubical isometries.
Rank
rank(X) := max{ k : there exists an isometric embedding ℝ^k → X }.
Rank-one element
An isometry g ∈ Γ is rank-one if g is hyperbolic and no axis of g bounds an isometrically embedded Euclidean half-flat ℝ×[0,∞) in X.
Theorem (Rank Dichotomy, Cat(0) cubical version)
Assume X is finite-dimensional, irreducible, and Γ acts essentially, properly, and cocompactly on X.
Then exactly one of the following holds:
(A) rank(X) ≥ 2 (equivalently, X contains an isometrically embedded Euclidean 2-flat)
(B) Γ contains a rank-one isometry.
Notes on assumptions
Essential means no global fixed point in X and no invariant convex subcomplex contained in a bounded neighborhood of a halfspace.
Irreducible means X does not split as a nontrivial cubical product.
Interface
This repo treats this theorem as the canonical claim boundary for rank-dichotomy-cat0.
Computational checks below are only for bounded instances and do not constitute a general proof.
