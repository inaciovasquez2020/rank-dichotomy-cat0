Theorem (informal)
Every finite-dimensional CAT(0) cube complex admits a dichotomy:
either it contains a rank-one isometry or it splits as a nontrivial product.

Status
The result is proven unconditionally. See STATUS.md for the authoritative claim boundary.

Scope
This repository is intentionally minimal.
